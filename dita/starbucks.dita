        Conveniently located within a short walking distance of the college campus, this Starbucks has a cozy charm, though it tends to stay busy. The mix of small tables and soft chairs is inviting, but the steady flow of students and faculty often means you’ll need to arrive early to snag a good spot. The large windows offer plenty of natural light, which adds to the comfortable feel despite the hustle.

        While the vibe is lively, it’s not always the most peaceful spot for deep reading. The abundance of students studying or working on group projects can make it feel more like a study hall than a reading nook. That said, the layout offers some quieter corners if you’re lucky enough to grab one.

        The extensive menu of baked goods and snacks ensures you won’t go hungry during your visit. A slice of pumpkin loaf or a warm bagel can be the perfect companion to your drink, and the variety of coffee and tea options provides alternatives to hot chocolate.
